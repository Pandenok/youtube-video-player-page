# Project: YouTube Video Page

## What's this

This is the first project in the [HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css) course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It involves building a YouTube’s video player page to practice embedding of images and video. The full assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/embedding-images-and-video).

## Live Demo

## Reflection

Even if it was not required in the assignment to build the exact replica

> The goal here isn’t to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things – embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side. 

I knocked myself out and used this opportunity to refresh some of the WebDev-101 Foundations on vanilla CSS.
It was fun and quick. The final result lacks only two things: responsiveness and tooltips.  

Here are a couple of solutions that I used:
- [Fluid Width Video](https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-video/)
- [Overlay Icons](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp)
